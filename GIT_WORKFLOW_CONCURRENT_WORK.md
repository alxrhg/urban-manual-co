# Git Workflow: Concurrent Work Explained

## Scenario 1: Two People Working on DIFFERENT Branches ✅ (Recommended)

**Branch A:** `claude/conversational-travel-intelligence`  
**Branch B:** `claude/other-task`

**What happens:**
- ✅ Both can push independently
- ✅ No conflicts (unless editing same files)
- ✅ When merging to master:
  - Git automatically merges both branches
  - If no conflicts → auto-merge success
  - If conflicts → manual resolution needed

**Example:**
```
You (Claude):     [commit 1] → [commit 2] → [commit 3] → Merge to master
                                                           ↓
Other work:       [commit A] → [commit B] → [commit C] → Merge to master
                                                           ↓
Master:           [commit 1][commit 2][commit 3][commit A][commit B][commit C]
```

## Scenario 2: Two People Working on SAME Branch ⚠️ (Requires Coordination)

**Same Branch:** `claude/conversational-travel-intelligence`

**What happens:**
- ⚠️ First push succeeds
- ⚠️ Second push fails: "remote ref is behind"
- ✅ Second person must: `git pull` → resolve conflicts → `git push`

**Example:**
```
You:      [commit 1] → [commit 2] → [push ✅]
                                              ↓
Other:    [commit 1] → [commit A] → [push ❌ FAILS]
                                              ↓
Other:    git pull → [merge commit] → [push ✅]
```

## Conflict Resolution

### When Conflicts Occur:
1. **Same file, different lines** → Usually auto-merge ✅
2. **Same file, same lines** → Manual resolution needed ⚠️
3. **Different files** → No conflicts ✅

### Example Conflict:
```typescript
// File: app/api/ai-chat/route.ts

// Your version:
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const session = await getOrCreateSession(userId);
  // ... your code
}

// Other person's version:
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const { query } = await request.json();
  // ... their code
}

// Git will mark conflict:
<<<<<<< HEAD
  const session = await getOrCreateSession(userId);
=======
  const { query } = await request.json();
>>>>>>> their-branch
```

## Best Practices

### ✅ Recommended: Separate Branches
- Each task gets its own branch
- Merge independently when ready
- Conflicts only if editing same files

### ⚠️ Same Branch: Coordinate
- Pull before pushing
- Communicate about changes
- Resolve conflicts together

---

## Real-World Example

**You (Claude):** Working on conversational AI
- Branch: `claude/conversational-travel-intelligence`
- Files: `app/api/ai-chat/route.ts`, `app/page.tsx`

**Other work:** Working on UI improvements
- Branch: `claude/ui-improvements`
- Files: `components/DestinationCard.tsx`, `app/page.tsx`

**Potential conflict:** Both edit `app/page.tsx`
- Git will merge automatically if different sections
- Manual resolution if same lines edited

**Solution:** 
- Work on different sections of `app/page.tsx`
- Or coordinate: "I'm working on search logic, you work on UI"

## Commands for Safe Concurrent Work

```bash
# Before starting work
git checkout master
git pull origin master  # Get latest changes

# Create your branch
git checkout -b claude/your-task

# Work and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your changes"

# Before pushing, check if others pushed
git pull origin claude/your-task  # If branch exists
# OR
git pull origin master  # To get latest master changes

# Resolve conflicts if any
# Then push
git push origin claude/your-task
```

## Summary

| Scenario | Can Push? | Conflicts? | Auto-Merge? |
|----------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Different branches | ✅ Yes | Only if same files | ✅ Usually |
| Same branch | ⚠️ Need pull first | If same lines | ❌ Manual |
| Different files | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ✅ Always |

**Answer:** Yes, two places can push at the same time if on different branches. When merging, Git will auto-merge without conflicts unless the same lines in the same files were edited.
