# Apps Workspace

This directory will host runnable applications managed by Turborepo:

- `web`: user-facing Next.js 16 experience.
- `cms`: Payload admin shell or future bespoke tools.
- `workers`: scheduled jobs / queue consumers.

During migration we will gradually move the existing root Next.js app into `apps/web`. Track progress via backlog items M0-M3.
