# GitHub Infrastructure

This folder will store workflow definitions, PR templates, issue templates, and any automation scripts that support the Turborepo migration.

- `workflows/`: GitHub Actions definitions.
- `templates/`: PR / issue templates.
- `scripts/`: helper utilities referenced by workflows.

Populate alongside the Turborepo scaffold tasks (see `docs/fresh_start_backlog.md`, items M3 & R1).
