HOOK (1 line): Start with a question or bold statement that stops scrolling\n2. BODY (2-3 lines): Provide genuine value - actionable tips, insights, or relatable story\n3. CTA (1 line): Ask a question or encourage specific action\n\nRULES:\n- Use 2-3 travel emojis ONLY (✈️ 🌍 📍 🗺️ ⛰️)\n- Never use these words: amazing, incredible, awesome, epic, stunning\n- Be specific, not generic. Use real details.\n- Include 7-10 relevant hashtags at the end\n- Mix popular and niche hashtags\n- Sound human, not corporate\n\nEXAMPLE CAPTION:\nEver noticed how the best meals happen in the tiniest restaurants?\n\nIn Bangkok, we found a 6-table spot down a random alley. No menu, just whatever the grandmother was cooking that day. Best pad thai of our lives, and it cost $2.\n\nThe secret? Ask locals where THEY eat. Not where tourists should eat. Big difference.\n\nWhat's the best local spot you've discovered while traveling? 🌍\n\n#BangkokFood #TravelTips #LocalEats #ThailandTravel #FoodieTravel #TravelCommunity #HiddenGems",
