## 2025-01-20 - Typography Standardization
**Learning:** Components often drift from the design system over time, using arbitrary values (e.g., `text-[11px]`) instead of standard tokens (`text-xs`). This inconsistency hurts maintainability and visual coherence. Standardizing to `text-xs` (12px) even when replacing smaller sizes (9px, 11px) generally improves readability and accessibility without breaking layouts, provided proper scaling (e.g., `scale-90`) is used where space is strictly limited.
**Action:** When auditing components, look for `text-[...]` arbitrary values. Replace them with design system tokens. If the standard token is too big for a tight specific layout (like a badge), use `text-xs scale-90` or similar transform-based sizing rather than hardcoded pixel values, to respect user font preferences and keep the system unified.
